This is a full download (via `wget -m -p -E -k -np`) of www.g4ilo.com website as of 2023-08-19.

After downloading his site (for prosperity), I realised my browsing of the internet had lead me to his site before. I (re)learnt of his site after seeing an ad posted for his SK (silent key) sale. I purchased a Kenwood TH-D72E handheld from Phil (M0AYB) who was helping Julian's wife to sort through all his things.

Julian died in 2014, and you can read his diary [here](https://onefootingrave.blogspot.com/).
