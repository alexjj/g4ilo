Dear Julian,<br><br>After much searching I found the best article about QFH antenna on your web site.  I followed your design and built one for Field Day earlier this year and had amazing success with a one-of-the-kind (S9) voice contact with the ISS crew member.  See me holding it proudly here http://goo.gl/BN2EDg <br><br>Thanks a lot for a great article.  <br><br>Best 73!<br>Umesh<br>K6VUG</p>

Hi Julian. I'm a fellow ham from France. I've been reading your whole site for a few days. Lots of useful information ! I was particularly interested by your articles on stealth ham radio, since I leave in an apartement building. Anyway. Only yesterday evening did I discover about your cancer. I was shocked. I'm deeply sorry to hear that. You have done so much for the ham community, it will leave a mark. I wish you to be able to do contacts and other things you like doing for the longest possible time.<br>My thoughts are with you.<br><br>73<br>Cedric</p>

Hi Julian,<br><br>I am so very sad to hear of your declining health.  My wife also has terminal brain tumour, so our thoughts and preys are with you and Olga. <br><br>Your technical & Radio blog I have referred to many times over the past years, especially on APRS.  Your sharing of information and findings has been very much appreciated not only by me, but undoubtable by many other Amateurs around the world.<br><br>Keep fighting, our thoughts are with you always. <br><br>Nigel VK3GY</p>

I was very impressed with your evaluations of various QRP antennas as I have just purchased a FT-817ND and a Buddipole Deluxe antenna. I added a dual band 2/440 antennna to the top of the buddipole versa tee which you can see on my web site listed above. You have a good web site, keep up the good work.<br>73</p>

<strong>From: </strong>Jim (N6MV) <br>
Hi Julian,<br>You put together a very nice webpage re: stealth antennas,and couldn't agree more with you as to how effective the MFJ 1786 Hi Q loop works over 10-30MHz, but that's not the case for the MFJ 1788 that covers 7-21 MHz; for it's 3ft diameter is simply too small on 7MHz and its efficiency on 40 meters is less than 10%. For 40 meters, the loop diameter needs to be at least 5 ft in diameter -so you are not operating with a &quot;wet noodle&quot;- which is the case with the MFJ 1788 on 40 meters. Similar to you, I have found that a Hi Q Loop is by far the best antenna for those who have very little real estate. Hope you are doing well, and once again, you are to be commended for your very informative webpage.<br><br>73 Jim (N6MV)</p>

What a wonderful website, Thank you very much for the effort you have put into your site for the benefit of us Radio Amateurs. As I am new to amateur radio it has been a great source of information and has answered a lot of my technical questions. As I explored your site, I become aware of your health issues and was taken by surprise ,it prompted me into dropping you a note to thank you personally, my prayers and thoughts are with you and Olga at this time,<br><br>73s Allan - ZL1AML</p>

Nice webside you have created! Interesting info about digimodes and other things. I have worked a little with D-Star and have installed a repeater LD8MM (UHF) and have also a Echolink aktive in 24 hours every day. It is easy to communicate when the antenna Daimon X-300 is in my garden! ;) I have also a Igate LA5XFA-10 active. OK...73´s .... de LA5XFA, Rolf  (locator: JP66UV)</p>
